      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
    
      <p>Fat and Happy!
        Don’t you wish you could eat something other than potatoes?
        I love diverse foods and I would like to create a website that has recipes for something other than burgers
        and fries.
        I grew up in Washington and served my mission in Mississippi and Louisiana. Washington has wonderful Asian
        cuisines and the south, that is what they are known for…FOOD. They are the fattest state. A motto I heard a
        lot there is “we’re fat and happy”. I want to make people happy, and food is the way there.
        I want to create a website to give diverse options of recipes that you won’t get tired of eating. The site
        will be user friendly and easy on the eyes.
        My favorite foods are “teriyaki chicken” and “gumbo” these will be the first foods I will want you to try
        yourself.
        </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience are those who are tired of the same bland food that is offered in this
        uncultured curlinary area with franchised foods. I having lived in two cultures that have amazing foods.
        Washington, home of delicious teriyaki. The south, Mississippi and Lousiana, where the fat are happy. I want
        to bring my happiness to others. This site will teach others about different culinary cultures and bring new
        and exciting flavours to the locals and visitor students of Rexburg, Idaho.

        [Fat and Happy
        I don’t know about any of you, but food does not always make me happy. There are times when certain foods sound good at the moment and taking that first bite helps with my craving. I take a second bite and it quiet wasn’t the same the first and each bite after that the craving continues to decline until you finish the meal and feel gross. I become unhappy and fat. There’s no perks. I’ll create the solution, become fat and happy. These recipes are known to be comfort food and they may not be the healthiest, but I know you’ll be happy afterwards.

        [Why will people come to your site?
        People will come to my site to get recipes that will feed them and their endorphins. These foods will fill you up with joy and happiness. The recipes are simple and user friendly to follow without the extra content. I don’t like when other sites have articles about the recipe, I just want the recipe without all the extras. I believe that’s what the people want. The content without the additional information.
      What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        What foods will not only feed them but make them feel good about eating the foods. They will have to put a little effort into their food but it’s only a little. If you’ve never cooked before this site will be easy to navigate the recipes easy to follow.
      What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        They will want to find recipes
      What information is necessary to complete any actions your sites offer?
        
      Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        Visitors will come to my site rather than the other ones because the simplicity. Google is known for their simple search page; I want my site to have the simplicity and success. I want to create a site that gets ride of the extra distracting ads and graphics and put what the people want and only what the people want. I don’t want to go onto a site to click through a maze just to find a simple recipe. The fewer the clicks the happier you’ll be and that’s what I hope to create with fat and happy.

        [Gumbo
        Gumbo is known as the ultimate comfort southern food. I remember I had a friend invite me over for a Sunday dinner. I asked what we were having? And they replied with the wonderful answer of Gumbo. There are different ways it can be prepared but the way I like is “Chicken and Sausage Gumbo”. This food is flavorful with a type of rich brown gravy/soup that is served over rice. With each bite you become happier, and that smile grows like the grinches heart. I always feel happy after some good ol’ gumbo.

    <h3>[Teriyaki]</h3>
    <p>
        [Teryiaki
        It’s a little healthier than gumbo but it still has the same effect. I grew up in Washington and teriyaki is everywhere! 10 minutes away from my house is my favorite place to eat. Teriyaki is grilled juicy chicken thighs that are sliced and coated in there sweet and tangy sauce. I could eat this chicken everyday of my life and be happy. With a side of rice and whatever vegetable you’d like and cover it with the sauce. I’ll be fat and happy every time I eat it.
