            <p> Fat and Happy I don’t know about any of you, but food does not always make me happy. There are times
                when certain foods sound good at the moment and taking that first bite helps with my craving. I take
                a second bite and it quiet wasn’t the same the first and each bite after that the craving continues
                to decline until you finish the meal and feel gross. I become unhappy and fat. There’s no perks.
                I’ll create the solution, become fat and happy. These recipes are known to be comfort food and they
                may not be the healthiest, but I know you’ll be happy afterwards.
            </p>

            <p> Why will people come to your site? People will come to my site to get recipes that will feed them and
                their endorphins. These foods will fill you up with joy and happiness. The recipes are simple and
                user friendly to follow without the extra content. I don’t like when other sites have articles about
                the recipe, I just want the recipe without all the extras. I believe that’s what the people want.
                The content without the additional information. What questions will your visitors expect your site
                to answer for them? What foods will not only feed them but make them feel good about eating the
                foods. They will have to put a little effort into their food but it’s only a little. If you’ve never
                cooked before this site will be easy to navigate the recipes easy to follow. What types of
                activities will visitors want to complete on your site? They will want to find recipes What
                information is necessary to complete any actions your sites offer? Why will your visitors come to
                your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? Visitors will come to
                my site rather than the other ones because the simplicity. Google is known for their simple search
                page; I want my site to have the simplicity and success. I want to create a site that gets ride of
                the extra distracting ads and graphics and put what the people want and only what the people want. I
                don’t want to go onto a site to click through a maze just to find a simple recipe. The fewer the
                clicks the happier you’ll be and that’s what I hope to create with fat and happy.
